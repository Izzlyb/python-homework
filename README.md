Repository for Module 2 Challenge - PyBank Python

## Goal

This challenge is to use all the learnings using Python to create an application
call PyBank where you will analyze the financial records of a company.

# Two projects are included in this repository:

1. PyBank

This project performs an analysis of bank statements from a company.

From this information, we had to present a report of the data that included:

- number of months of data
- Total profit/losses
- the average change between one month to the next
- the greatest increase in revenues and the month in which they occurred and
- the greatest decrease of revenues and the month in which they occurred

2. PyRamen

The second project in the challenge was the analysis of a restaurant.

- the menu items that were served and the financial data per menu item
- we had to total the profits, cogs, revenues for each menu item.
